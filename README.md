# ShaderExample

This contains the lesson follow-along and homework assignment for the 7th class of the FA23 Speaking Shaders course with Parsons Design and Technology.

This is a long document but some of it will be very straighforward for some students. So I ask that the students please take care to help one another and try to go over this document together in a group session. Most of this is going to be about getting familiar with a new process.

You will need to install both Blender and Unity to continue with this section. And this document will walk you through the process of importing and setting up a scene from Mario 64 in Unity. This is the basic unit of work we will be expecting to do in the second half of the class where we will try to recreate scenes from things we like!

Good luck
